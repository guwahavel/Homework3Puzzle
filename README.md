You are they grey square and the goal of each level is to reach the black tile.
This puzzle is inspired by the multicolor tile puzzle from the game Undertale.


Tile Properties:

Pink - Nothing special

Red - Impassable wall

Yellow - Electric, will push you back when stepped on

Orange - Sets your flavor to "Orange" when stepped on

Purple - Slippery, you will slide forward when stepping on it. You will also have your flavor set to "Lemon"

Blue - If adjacent to a Yellow tile, becomes electrified and pushes you back when stepped on, or if your flavor is "Orange" (fishes eat you)

Green - Sets your flavor to "Pineapple"

Cyan - Guardian tile, only lets you pass if your flavor is "Pineapple" and removes your flavor if you pass through it

Black - The end goal of the level, takes you to the next level
